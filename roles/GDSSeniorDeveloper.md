# Senior Developer

## GDS

The Government Digital Service is the digital, technology and data centre for government. We support departments as they transform the way they work. Our strategy is to deliver - often, iteratively - services that meet citizens’ needs not government needs. 

We work in small, agile teams of developers, designers, content designers and others. We always ask how we can make things better for users, who are at the centre of everything we do. We designed, built and run GOV.UK, the starting point for 60 million citizens to experience government. We have also transformed some of the biggest services, making them simpler, clearer and faster to use. 

Over the next 5 years, together with departments, we will be building new digital, technology and data platforms for the whole of government. Solving common challenges once, so that all services work in the same, simple, easy way. These platforms will also make services much cheaper and quicker to build and operate. We will make better use of data to drive continuous improvement, ensure government has the right technology and that spending is controlled. 

You can keep up-to-date with our work on the GDS Technology Blog. 

Help us make government better.
