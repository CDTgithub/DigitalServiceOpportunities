Agile coaches will be working directly with government departments and agencies, to help organisations, portfolios, programmes and teams to be as effective as possible by embedding an agile culture.The focus is increasingly on building and maintaining the internal capabilities of departments to effectively govern, deliver and run digital services being built and provide an environment that enables continuous delivery in perpetuity. The input of an agile coach is integral to ensure departmentsâ€™ agile practices and team capabilities are set up to support this.
