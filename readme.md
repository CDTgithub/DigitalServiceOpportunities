# Digital Services for the State of California

> If the product doesn't work for the end user – even if it is on-time and on-budget – then we have failed. As we embark on new projects every day – including how to create a licensing and track and trace process for medical cannabis from scratch – we are working with this new principle: 

> *Users matter*.

## We're putting user needs first

California’s [Department of Technology](http://www.cio.ca.gov/) (CDT) is one of the largest technology suppliers for state and local government in California. Together with state agencies and entities, we deliver technology for everyone. To meet Secretary Batjer’s challenge, our department is changing: adding new skills and new capabilities to support a culture of understanding user needs – not just government needs – and making sure we meet them.

## What we've started 

![Some of the Child Welfare Digital Service team at an 18F workshop session](/images/CWDS.jpeg) 

Our demonstrator projects (the [California’s Child Welfare Digital Service](https://cwds.ca.gov), and more to come) start by understanding user needs, work iteratively with the private sector partners, and build in the open: because it makes things better.

You can [read more about the Child Welfare Digital Service](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/11/17/leadership-innovation-california-child-welfare-services/) in a blog post hosted by our friends at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov) by Stuart Drown, the deputy Secretary for California's [Government Operations Agency](http://www.govops.ca.gov) and Michael Wilkening, the under-Secretary for California's [Health and Human Services Agency](http://www.chhs.ca.gov) (CHHS).

At CHHS, the [Office for Systems Integration](http://osi.ca.gov) (OSI) has the massive job of being responsible for all the technology behind health and human services for all Californians, like child welfare. With the Child Welfare Digital Service, CHHS and OSI, in partnership with the California Department of Technology, have risen to the challenge of making sure our technology meets users' needs.

But, there's a lot more to do. 

## Join us 

Our work in modernizing and building delivering new digital services for the state means we need people who're experienced in designing and delivering shared services across multiple technical platforms.  

Across the Department of Technology, the Office for Systems Integration and new teams like the Child Welfare Digital Service, we're looking for researchers, designers, content designers, strategists, architects, developers and more to deliver digital services that meet user needs.

Join us, and help deliver simpler, clearer, faster digital services for everyone in California.
