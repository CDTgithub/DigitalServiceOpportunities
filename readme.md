# Digital Services for the State of California

> If the product doesn't work for the end user – even if it is on-time and on-budget – then we have failed. As we embark on new projects every day – including how to create a licensing and track and trace process for medical cannabis from scratch – we are working with this new principle: 
> *Users matter*.

> Secretary Marybel Batjer, California Government Operations Agency
> [Code for America Summit, November 2, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb8fZrrDT00)

California’s Department of Technology is one of the largest technology suppliers for state and local government in California. Together with state agencies and entities, we deliver technology for everyone. To meet Secretary Batjer’s challenge, our department is changing: adding new skills and new capabilities to support a culture of understanding user needs – not just government needs – and making sure we meet them.

Our demonstrator projects (California’s Child Welfare Digital Service, with more to come) start by understanding user needs, work iteratively with the private sector partners, and build in the open: because it makes things better. 

Join us, and help deliver simpler, clearer, faster digital services for everyone in California.
